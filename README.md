Migrate devices using Carbonite Migrate.

# User requirements
## The following software must be running/installed on the client computer:
1. Device42 16.08.03+
2.	Carbonite console 8.3.0.293+
3.	PowerShell 5.1: if you are using Windows 10, you already have the necessary version of PowerShell, if you are using Windows 7/8/8.1; please download the Windows Management Framework 5.1 that includes the necessary updates to Windows PowerShell -> [Download WMF 5.1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54616)
4.	For convenience, you can use PowerShell ISE, which includes a dual screen layout where you can view the script and run it at the same time using a GUI. Run it by pressing the Windows key and typing “powershell ise”.

4.	You will be prompted to save a CSV export file with server information for the migration. Save it to some directory. This file is used to enter server data into the PowerShell script and Carbonite job creation.
# Using a PowerShell Carbonite migration script
1.	Install the Carbonite client.
2.	Download the D42 Carbonite PowerShell scripts from the D42 GitHub page at: [Carbonite migration scripts](https://github.com/device42/carbonite-migrate)
3.	Now run the script by entering its name from the PowerShell: `./ESX-EVRAMigrationJobScript.ps1`
4.	Answer questions when prompted:

5.	You will also be asked to create a replica name which will be the name of the migrated machine on the VMware server and the name appearing in D42. You can use tags such as: 

    ```
    {YYYY} = 4 digit year
    {MM} = 2 digit month
    {DD} = 2 digit day
    {HH} = 2 digit hour
    {SS} = 2 digit second
    {MS} = milliseconds
    {IP} = IP of the new VM
    ```
    With these tags you can create unique names, for example entering: `"d42-carbonite-{IP}.{YYYY}{MM}{DD}"` will create a name equivalent to: `"d42-carbonite-[vmware host ip].20200412"` for example.

6.	The script will execute and issue a job id # upon completion:

7.	While the script is running or when it has finished, you will check the job status and modify the D42 device, which was migrated by running the job monitoring script `"JobMonitorScript.ps1"`.

# Using the job monitoring script
1.	Run the script by entering its name from the PowerShell: `./JobMonitorScript.ps1`
2.	Answer questions when prompted similar to the above migration script.  
3.	The script will report on the job status of the migration updating every 30 seconds.
4.	Once the job completes and the job fails over (successfully completes), the script will mark the old device as not in service:  
5.	A new device which has been migrated over to, should be automatically added with the name you’ve given your replica in the migrate script step:
